# Digital-Coworkers

To create a Python solution with an OpenAI backend that acts as a digital coworker, capable of understanding tasks described in plain English, executing these tasks, and reporting back, involves integrating several technologies and components. Given the complexity of the task and potential security-sensitive operations (like connecting to servers or databases), the following outline provides a high-level approach rather than direct execution of commands from text input for security reasons.

Outline:

#### Task Interpretation with OpenAI: Use OpenAI's API to interpret tasks described in plain English and map them to predefined scripts or actions.

#### Task Execution Framework: Define a framework for executing different types of tasks, such as checking server memory usage or generating reports from a database.

#### Keyword Association and Script Activation: Associate keywords from the interpreted tasks with technical steps/scripts written in Python or Node.js.

#### Execution Scheduling: Implement a scheduling mechanism for tasks that need to be executed periodically.

#### Reporting: Design a system for compiling execution outputs and sending reports to specified email addresses.

Example Code Snippet for Task Interpretation and Mapping:

code.py is an example demonstrating how to interpret a task using OpenAI and map it to a predefined action. The actual execution of tasks, especially ones that involve sensitive operations, should be handled carefully with proper security measures.
